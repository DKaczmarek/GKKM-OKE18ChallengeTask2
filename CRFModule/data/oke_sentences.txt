In 1976, director Derek Jarman's debut feature film Sebastiane prompted newspaper outrage with its plentiful nudity, gay Roman soldiers and Latin dialogue. Jarman was one of Britain's boldest directors - and his partner says he would have adored the freedom of modern film-making. Keith Collins caught Derek Jarman's eye in 1986 at a festival of gay and lesbian cinema in Newcastle. Jarman was instantly smitten with the much younger computer programmer, then employed on secret Ministry of Defence projects. "I'd gone with a gang of mates to see Gus Van Sant's Mala Noche and Wieland Speck's film Westler," Collins recalls.

Now D’Antoni is thriving in Houston. The bailouts from New York — Jackson’s included if there is no playoff run — may have only just begun.

The common thread from Peoria to Pinner to Perugia was a surge of angry resentment at establishment politicians - a populist revolt against being told what it is acceptable to think about issues like globalisation, migration and Europe.

However, while the shoot took only 25 days, Jenkins says he conceived the project "at least three-and-a-half years ago". He explains: "That's fairly average because it takes a long time for a film to get made.

To give you an idea of how fractured and confused politics is in Greece right now, let me recount a conversation I had with a Greek journalist before the election who was explaining to me why he wasn't planning to vote Syriza. The reforms imposed upon Greece by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the EU - while painful - were a necessary step, he said, to shake the country out of a state of moribund corruption. "You probably think I'm really right wing," he added, apologetically. "I'm not, honestly, I'm very centrist. I love Marx."

Fans ultimately complain that the dysfunction traces to Dolan, and they are not all wrong about that. For one thing, he’s the genius who chose Anthony over Coach Mike D’Antoni in 2012 when D’Antoni complained that building an offense around Anthony’s isolation skills in the evolving N.B.A. was akin to driving cross-country in a covered wagon. Now D’Antoni is thriving in Houston. The bailouts from New York — Jackson’s included if there is no playoff run — may have only just begun.

Since it was founded in 1987, the National Museum of Women in the Arts has worked to preserve and share the legacies of such subversive heroines, specifically those engaged in creative work. The only major museum in the world dedicated to celebrating the history of women-identified artists, the NMWA works to derail the longstanding habit of overlooking, undermining and erasing the work of women from the canon. If you won’t be in Washington, D.C., for the Women’s March, don’t fret. The best part about the NMWA is that, in essence, every tour is a “Nasty Women” tour.

As Derrick Rose said Tuesday upon his return from a one-night detour to Chicago, “things happen.” This is not to argue that Rose had no acceptable reason — a “family issue,” he said — for missing the Knicks’ 110-96 loss to the New Orleans Pelicans at Madison Square Garden on Monday night, the team’s eighth defeat in nine games in a season turning familiarly sour.

Samsung Electronics Co's (005930.KS) sponsorship of the equestrian-athlete daughter of a long-time friend of President Park Geun-hye has helped to land South Korea's top company in the center of the country's influence-peddling scandal. Samsung agreed last year to pay $18 million to Core Sports International GmbH, a consulting firm controlled by Park's friend Choi Soon-sil, who is in jail and faces charges of abuse of power and fraud in a criminal trial that began this month.
